The infrastructure
------------------

- Free software (AGPLv3).
    - "As such, ownCloud is very similar to the widely-used Dropbox, with the
      primary difference being that ownCloud is free and open-source, and
      thereby allowing anyone to install and operate it without charge on a
      private server, with no limits on storage space (except for hard disk
      capacity) or the number of connected clients."
- Server-side: php.
- Desktop clients
    - Sinchronize files with the server.
    - windows, osx, linux, ios, android.
- Web interface to access files, calendar, contacts, etc.
- WebDAV (SabreDAV)
- Multiple backend database management systems
    - sqlite
    - mariadb
    - mysql
    - oracle
    - mssql
    - postgresql
