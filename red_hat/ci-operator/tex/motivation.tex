    \note{
        Continuing with the historical theme, but moving on to motivation, there
        is a presentation by Michalis which was posted in our chat recently.  It
        is contemporaneous --- n.b.: four days before the beginning of the
        \texttt{ci-operator} repository/history --- and goes through many of the
        problems the CI system at the time had.

    \note{
        They can be summarized mostly with one word.

        The CI "system" was a mixture of Ruby (as was OpenShift v2), Python, and
        Bash scripts, used a very inefficient model on top of that, and was
        mostly unmaintained and unmaintainable.

        Meanwhile, Kubernetes (our upstream project) had \texttt{test-infra} and
        Prow: a CI system which used the platform itself and a language and
        concepts that were familiar to OpenShift developers.

        OpenShift also had many unique features which could be used to extend
        the upstream system (at the time, many were later contributed upstream,
        although a unique set still remains).

        So we decided to adopt Prow and integrate it into our product.

        cluster (in the form of a \texttt{Pod} spec).

        using files under \texttt{ci-operator/jobs} in the
        \texttt{openshift/release} repository.  Note that this is extremely
        anachronistic, almost nothing shown here existed at the time:

            \item images were not imported from other clusters
            \item there was no results server

        However, we do not want every user to have to build their CI pipeline
        from zeroâ€¦
